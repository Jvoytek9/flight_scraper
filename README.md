# What is this
Scraping airports across world and getting iata codes for each airport. This was a project I did on the side during my internship at GoWith. I was curious to see if I could apply the results to the internship and assist in the next step of the development of the app. Ultimately it was not used for other reasons, but the project was fruitful and interesting in my opinion.

# Installation
If interested in running a local version, clone this repo and make sure to have pip installed.

Then, make a separate virtualenv like so (this example makes a virtual environment named venv at the given path): python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv

copy the contents of the cloned repo into this new venv folder. Activate the venv like so: cd venv\path\to\myenv\Scripts then type "activate" and hit enter

The name of your venv should appear next to the command prompt. Now type: cd ..

And finally: pip install the several packages that are required.
