 Scraping airports across world and getting iata codes for each airport. This was a project I did on the side during my internship at GoWith. I was curious to see if I could apply the results to the internship and assist in the next step of the development of the app. Ultimately it was not used for other reasons, but the project was fruitful and interesting in my opinion.
